    <i>5G</i> is the latest (as of 2022) generation of mobile networks. <i>5G</i> began deployment in 2019 across the world and is set to be the successor to <b>4G/4GLTE</b>. The GSM Association predicts <i>5G</i> to have more than 1.7 billion subscribers across the world by 2025.

    Additionally, <i>5G</i> will allow for more devices to be connected and be more unified in crowded areas that in turn will increase the quality of Internet services. However, due to the increased bandwidth and performance, <b>4G/LTE</b> devices will not have the capability to connect to <i>5G</i>, only <i>5G</i>-enabled devices will be able to connect. 
    There was a lot of controversy surrounding <i>5G</i> upon release; some claiming <i>5G</i> caused COVID-19, others believing it caused health effects such as ADHD, Alzheimer's Disease and heart tumors, however these false claims lack scientific evidence to support them and have been since disproved by the World Health Organization.
    These claims did not only arise from the introduction of <i>5G</i> though, these claims began back in the 1990's and have persisted.
