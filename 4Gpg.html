    <i>4G</i> stands for 4th Generation. <i>4G</i> is the fourth evolution of cellular networks, preceding <b>5G</b> and succeeding <b>3G</b>.

    <i>4GLTE</i> was released commercially in 2009 in Norway, Oslo and Stockholm, Sweden. It has been debated as to if the first generation releases should be considered <i>4GLTE</i>. Often times, <b>3GPP LTE</b> is branded as <i>4GLTE</i> however it does not comply fully with the IMT-Advanced requirements.
    IMT-Advanced requirements for <i>4G</i> include a basis on an all-IP packet switched network, up to 1 Gbit/s for low mobility and up to 100 Mbit/s for high mobility, ability to dynamically use and share network resources to allow more concurrent users per cell.
    Peak download and upload speeds for <i>4GLTE-Advanced</i> are 1000 Mbit/s and 500 Mbit/s, respectively. In the US, large carrier Sprint shut down their WiMAX network on March 31, 2016 and T-Mobile, who merged with Sprint in April 2020, plans to shut down their <i>4GLTE</i> network on June 30, 2022.
