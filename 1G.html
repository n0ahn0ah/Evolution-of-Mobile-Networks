    Launched in Tokyo, Japan 1979, the first commercially automated cell network was released to the metropolitan area of Tokyo by NTT.
    In under 5 years, this network had expanded across the entirety of Japan's population as well as becoming the first nationwide <a class="hlnk" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1G"><i>1G</i></a> network.  <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/DynaTAC8000X.jpg" align="left" style="margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px"height="125px" width="75px"></a>

    The Nordic Mobile Telephone system was launched simultaneously in Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark. This was the first mobile network to include international roaming.
    Just 2 years later, in 1983, the Chicago-based company Ameritech released the first <i>1G</i> network in the USA. The mobile phone released with <i>1G</i> in the US was the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X, a phone that was priced at $3,995 in 1983. Other countries such as the UK, Mexico and Canada followed suit in releasing <i>1G</i> mobile phones in the early to mid-1980's.
<i>1G</i> is a reference to the first generation of mobile telecommunications. These are the standards for analog telecommunications produced in the 1980's and remained until the digital upgrade to <b>2G</b> was introduced in 1991. The largest difference between <i>1G</i> and <b>2G</b> is that <b>2G</b> audio transmissions were completely digital whereas <i>1G</i> was analog.
