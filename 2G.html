    <i>2G</i>, which stands for second-generation cellular network, was launched in 1991 on the GSM standard by Radiolinja in Finland. <i>2G</i> is the successor to <b>1G</b>, featuring digitally encrypted phone conversations, more users allowed per frequency band due to more efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum.
    <i>2G</i> was also the first network to include data services for mobile, allowing users to send SMS text messages.  These technologies that <i>2G</i> enabled include networks providing picture, text and MMS (multimedia messages) messages.

    <i>2G</i> compared to our current standards is rather sluggish as opposed to <b>4G/4GLTE</b>. <i>2G</i> has a speed range of 64Kbps to 256Kbps whereas <b>4G</b> has a speed range of 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps. That's 10^6 of what <i>2G</i> was able to offer at it's highest performance.
    For the time however, <i>2G</i> was revolutionary in what it gave way to and in it's performance. Although <i>2G</i> is generally less used currently due to better technology being available in most places, many still use devices running off <i>2G</i> like the UK who widely uses <i>2G</i> for <a class="hlnk" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone">dumbphones</a> and vehicle tracking devices. 
    Despite it's  old technology, <i>2G</i> still remains a useful service for locations where the price to run newer services is too high.
