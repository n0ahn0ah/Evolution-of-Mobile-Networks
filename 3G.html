     <i>3G</i>, an abbreviaton for 3ʳᵈ generation, was launched commercially in mid-2001. The first pre-commercial <i>3G</i> network was launched in Japan in 1998 under the name, FOMA, standing for the Freedom of Mobile multimedia Access.
     The first commercially available <i>3G</i> mobile network was released by NTT DoCoMo in Japan on October 1ˢᵗ, 2001. <i>3G</i> was not provided with a clear definition of what the rate of upload/download is, although ITU expected to have a minimum data rate of 2Mbit/s for walking and stationary users and 348 kbit/s in moving vehicles. <i>3G</i> provides much more security than it's previous iteration, <b>2G</b>. 
     The UE (User Equipment) authenticates the network to ensure it is a verified <i>3G</i> network and not an impersonation of one.
